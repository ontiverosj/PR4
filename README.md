Question one. I think id selectors are annoying going back and trying to fix them was a pain, I releasized the a lot of the things and had to change would not change because of the id selectors. and I would have to remember what I changed and go back and try diferent things around the id selectors. I would have to go back in my css and find out which 2 selectors or each selector. 

Question two. I recommend using class selectors because they are in set of the element you are working on and for me and it more organized instead of having multiple selectors for the same element I just had one and can change things easier with my class. I will defintly be working on the class selectors.
